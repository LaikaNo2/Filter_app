# Filter app

The 'Filter_app' is a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) provides a graphical user interface for the function `plot_FilterCombinations()` from the **R** package ['Luminescence'](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Luminescence). The app allows visualising optical filter characteristics, including optical density 
and transmission data needed in the broader context of [luminescence dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminescence_dating).

The application was developed in framework of an internship at the 
[IRAMAT-CRP2A](http://www.iramat-crp2a.cnrs.fr/spip/) at the Universit√© Bordeaux Montaigne, France. 

**Due to legal restrictions the app itself comes without *any* filter data, but a template that can be quickly filled with own information. For details see below.**
